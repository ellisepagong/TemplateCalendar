# üìö Template Calendar

This is an ongoing project of mine to improve my understanding of JavaScript, learn Spring, Hibernate JPA, and Docker!

## üóìÔ∏è Project Description

Everyone has those tasks and commitments that happen pretty regularly, but you *don‚Äôt really care which day you do them.* Sure, you could set a reminder saying 'Do laundry' every saturday, but... 

> Oh no! You get invited to an all-day event this Saturday.

Now you have to reschedule your laundry day to sunday, and your calendar asks if *every* laundry day should move to Sunday. 

That‚Äôs not too bad for one chore, but multiply that across groceries and cleaning, not to mention your professional commitments... and your calendar suddenly becomes a headache.

### That's where this app comes in. Check this out:

See those saved tasks and templates? Instead of strict recurring events, you save flexible tasks and groups of tasks called templates. Just drag and drop them onto any free day. Got a sudden conflict? No worries, just drag that to another date, and you're all set.

No rescheduling. No endless confirmations. Just a simple way to keep up with the things that matter, at the pace that works for you.


## üß© Personal Goals
This project serves as a hands-on refresher of backend Java development, as well as a learning tool and a portfolio piece with the goals of:

- Reviewing and recalling **Java backend** and **OOP fundamentals**

- Building familiarity with the **Spring Boot ecosystem** (JPA, repositories, controllers, and service layers)

- Learning **API containerization** with Docker

- Improving understanding of **JavaScript**, with previous experience with in-line JavaScript in HTML and CSS

- Applying previous experience in **software automation testing** with Selenium, and learning **API testing** with Postman.
