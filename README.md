# 📚 Template Calendar (Ongoing Project)

## 🗓️ Project Description

This is an ongoing project for a web-based calendar application designed around flexible, habit-based planning. Instead of assigning recurring tasks to rigid schedules, users can create reusable task templates (like a "Grocery Run" or "Monthly budget check") and assign them to any date that fits their availability.

The app aims to support:

- Delegation of grouped tasks

- Scheduling of recurring but irregular routines

- A more adaptable alternative to traditional calendar apps

Designed for users who plan around routines but need the flexibility to shift things when life gets busy.


## 🧩 Personal Goals
This project serves as a hands-on refresher of backend Java development, as well as a learning tool and a portfolio piece with the goals of:

- Reviewing and recalling **Java backend** and **OOP fundamentals**

- Building familiarity with the **Spring Boot ecosystem** (JPA, repositories, controllers, and service layers)

- Learning **API containerization** with Docker

- Improving understanding of **JavaScript**, with previous experience with in-line JavaScript in HTML and CSS

- Applying previous experience in **software automation testing** with Selenium, and learning **API testing** with Postman.
